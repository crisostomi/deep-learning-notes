Learning is about \emph{describing} data, or more specifically, describing the \emph{process}, or \emph{model}, that yields a given output from a given input.

Our model might use \emph{prior knowledge} on the data. For example, in the third plot, we might know a priori that the data actually comes from a periodic process $y = a\sin(x) + bx +c$.
In general, one should look at the world, identify what knowledge he has about it, and use this knowledge to construct his model.
Some forms of prior knowledge are for example
\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{data distribution}, e.g. we know that the data come from an oscillatory process, thus they must follow a periodic distribution;
	\item \emph{energy function}, e.g. we know that the data come from an energy-minimizing process;
	\item \emph{constraints}, e.g. we know that all the data come from a fixed camera, of which we know all the intrinsic parameters;  
	\item \emph{invariances}, e.g. we work on pictures of snowflakes, which are rotationally symmetric;
	\item \emph{input-output examples} (data prior).
\end{itemize}
All these encode, to different extents, some expected behaviour.
