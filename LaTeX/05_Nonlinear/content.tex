Having more data allows us to improve our predictions but can even confute some assumptions, \textit{e.g.} in the following figure, having more data confutes the assumption that the distribution of data behaves linearly
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{05/quadfit3}
	\caption{More data confutes the linear assumption.}\label{fig:conf_assump}	
\end{figure}

Therefore, we face some key questions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item How to select the right distribution?
	\item How much data do we need?
	\item What if the correct distribution does not admit a simple expression?
\end{itemize}
